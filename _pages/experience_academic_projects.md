#### Machine Translation Evaluation [Dec 2015 - June 2017, M.Tech Dissertation]
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Hard problem, since it relates to the unresolved problem of semantic equivalence  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Explored mapping function across different automatic and human evaluation metrics  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Manual metric: Adequacy and automatic metrics: BLEU, NIST, METEOR, TER & WER  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Applied Pearson's and Kendall's tau correlation coefficient for statistical analysis  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Used Moses, tercom and meteor.1.5 tools-kits
