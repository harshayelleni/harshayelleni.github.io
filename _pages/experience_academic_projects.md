### Data Science Analyst, Ntwist(Finmee Technologies Pvt. Ltd.), CIE, IIIT H, Hyderabad, India  
####JULY 2017 - MARCH 2018
* Build simulator for a gas-plant using deep learning techniques. MLP & LSTM were used as basic models
* Used Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL) to achieve optimal production for gas-plant
* DQN and Actor-Critic RL models were explored in depth
* More than 500+ experiments are performed for tuning hyper-parameters and to get the right models
* Keras and Tensorflow deep learning libraries are used in all implementations
* Other than machine learning many statistics based problems were solved like finding correlation and co-occurrence between two or more attributes on the large data set(2.1M)
