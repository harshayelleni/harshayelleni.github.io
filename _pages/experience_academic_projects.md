# Experience   
#### Data Science Analyst, Ntwist (Finmee Technologies), CIE, IIITH, Hyderabad, India [July 2017 - March 2018]
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Build simulator for a gas-plant using deep learning techniques  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Applied Deep Reinforcement Learning to achieve optimal production for gas-plant  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Leveraged DQN and Actor-Critic RL models to learn optimal policies  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Used Keras and Tensorflow deep learning libraries

# Academic Projects  
#### Machine Translation Evaluation [Dec 2015 - June 2017, M.Tech Dissertation]
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Hard problem, since it relates to the unresolved problem of semantic equivalence  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Explored mapping function across different automatic and human evaluation metrics  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Manual metric: Adequacy and automatic metrics: BLEU, NIST, METEOR, TER & WER  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Applied Pearson's and Kendall's tau correlation coefficient for statistical analysis  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Used Moses, tercom and meteor.1.5 tools-kits

#### Detecting In-line Mathematical Expression [Sep 2018 - Nov 2018, PhD Course Project]
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Identify complex mathematical structure, variable, operators, formula & notations within sentence  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Can be a new search functionality in search engines and an efficient alternate of OCR  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Formulated problem as a supervised learning problem  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; We applied and tested three models: CRF, naive Bayes, and MLP model  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; We outperformed previous best by securing 97.63% f-measure score
