Prior to IIT Hyderabad, I did my BTech from [NIT Andhra Pradesh](https://nitandhra.ac.in/main/) in _Computer Science and Engineering_. 
I did an Internship at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) during my 2nd year under [Prof. D. Janakiram](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/profile.php?arg=MzA=) for developing BOSS Linux kernels(Indian Linux distro). It involves kernel compilation and making bootable kernels using C++ (to introduce Object Orientedness) instead of traditional C.
