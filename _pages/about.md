### Hey, I'm Kaushal Kumar Maurya!


I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iith.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Techonlogy Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/). I am advised by Dr. [Maunendra Sankar Desarkar](https://www.iith.ac.in/~maunendra/).


My research goal is oriented towards applied machine learning for natural language processing. In particular, I leverage deep learning and deep reinforcement learning to solve challenging natural language generation problems. I have been mostly approaching problems from the ligustic side. Being a multilingual myself, I vision a need of cross-ligual/multi-lingual generation models (specifically, for Indian languages). Which can be directly applied to low-resoruce setting for convestion genearion, distractor generation, question queneation, text summerization, etc. I previously worked on in-line mathamtical expression detection, evaluation of text generaion and distractor generation (generation of incorrect ).
