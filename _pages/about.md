### Hey, I'm Sai Harsha Yelleni!


I am an MTech Research Assistant in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iith.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Techonlogy Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/). I am advised by [Prof. C. Krishna Mohan](https://www.iith.ac.in/cse/ckm/) and [Dr. P. K. Srijith](https://www.iith.ac.in/cse/srijith/).


Prior to IIT Hyderabad, I did my BTech from [NIT Andhra Pradesh](https://nitandhra.ac.in/main/) in _Computer Science and Engineering_. 
I did an Internship at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) during my 2nd year under [Prof. D. Janakiram](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/profile.php?arg=MzA=) for developing BOSS Linux kernels(Indian Linux distro). It involves kernel compilation and making bootable kernels using C++ (to introduce Object Orientedness) instead of traditional C.
