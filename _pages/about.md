### Hey, I'm Kaushal Kumar Maurya!


I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iith.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Techonlogy Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/). I am advised by Dr. [Maunendra Sankar Desarkar](https://www.iith.ac.in/~maunendra/).


My research goal is oriented towards applied machine learning for natural language processing. In particular, I leverage deep learning and deep reinforcement learning to solve challenging natural language generation problems. I have been mostly approaching problems from the ligustic side. Towards realizing this, I am working on Multimodal narrative Intelligence for my thesis.


Kaushal Kumar Maurya received his B.Tech and M.Tech degrees in 2014 and 2017 from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of Uttar Pradesh Technical University (UPTU) and Hyderabad Central University (HCU), respectively. Since July 2018, he is pursuing a Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH). His current research interests are in the area of natural language processing and deep reinforcement learning, including natural language generation, cross-lingual transfer learning, and conversational AI.
