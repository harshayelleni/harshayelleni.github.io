## Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning for Low-resource Languages Generation 
India is a linguistically very diverse country with 122 major languages and 1599 other languages. The majority of the text, documents, and other resources are available in the English language, which is known as high-resource language. The rest of the languages are known as low-resource (or resource-constrained ) languages.  Development of a cross-lingual system for the low-resource language will boost up the regional customer support services, reach a large number of local and professional audiences, fill the communication gaps, etc. Since the mother tongue remains a better and quicker way to acquire information, providing people with vital information in the mother language is preferred. The research in the low-resource language is understudy due to the unavailability of the large data. To overcome this **_we aim to develop cross-lingual language generation models for unseen low-resource languages by leveraging high-resource language (i.e., English) datasets._** The model will have two phases: unsupervised pre-training and model fine-tuning. The unsupervised pre-training will encourage the model to learn shared latent representation for different languages. These representations can be utilized as supervised signals for downstream zero-shot cross-lingual tasks in the fine-tuning phase of the model.

## Engaging Humans with Conversational AI: Automated Generation of Long and Multi-turn Natural Conversations
Conversational AI (Conv-AI) is the study of techniques for software agents that can engage in natural conversation with humans. The modern Conversational systems, Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri Google Home, and Microsoft Cortana, focus on short instructions such as playing music or asking for information, as opposed to longer free-form conversations that occur naturally in social and professional human interaction. I am mainly interested in the problem of **_automated generation of long and multi-turn utterances of a conversation given a context._** This can be useful: for customer support; for empowering interactive healthcare care; for the additional dataset, which can be augmented with other machine learning-based models, etc. The problem is challenging because of semantic and functional dependencies like co-reference relation (i.e., identifying two or more expressions in a text refer to the same person or thing), dialogue elements, and context. To achieve this goal, we will leverage modern neural architecture (i.e., Transformers), attention models (i.e., self-attention, cross-attention, etc.), and contextual text representations (i.e., BERT, GPT, etc.).
