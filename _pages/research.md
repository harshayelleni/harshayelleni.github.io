My research interests lies in developing robust Artificial Intelligent models using Traditional and Bayesian Deep Learning. Brief details of few projects are given below:

## Bayesian Deep Learning for computer vision and autonomous driving 
With  the  advancements  made  in  deep  learning, computer vision problems like object detection and segmentation  have  seen  a  great  improvement  inperformance.  However, in many real world applications such as autonomous driving vehicles, risk associated with incorrect predictions are very high. Standard deep learning techniques are often over-confident  in  their  predictions  and  does  not  takeinto account the uncertainty in predictions on out-of-distribution data. **_We aim to develop Bayesian Deep Learning models which can be deployed in real world by handling openset conditions._**

## Video Bokeh (Real-time person segmentation for mobile edge device deployments)
There is a specific requirement of developing a bokeh solution, which blurs out the non-person portion of the image in online meeting softwares and on mobile phones which offer it as a feature. For such a solution to work in real-world scenarios, **_we have to deal with limited labeled segmentation data available, the trade-offs of model accuracy vs inference speed, model size vs accuracy, input constraints vs performance etc._** With the help of developing an optimum balance of above trade-offs, using a Tensorflow model we can harness the pre-designed quantisation methods and achieve the market standard solution. It involves developing an accurate instance segmentation model and a fast blurring algorithm to be combined in an android application.
