My current research include corss-ligual transfer learning for language genenration and conversational AI. Brief details of few active projects are given below:

### Engaging Humans with Conversational AI: Automated Generation of Long and Multi-turn Natural Conversations
Conversational AI (Conv-AI) is the study of techniques for software agents that can engage in natural conversation with humans. The modern Conversational systems, Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri Google Home, and Microsoft Cortana, focus on short instructions such as playing music or asking for information, as opposed to longer free-form conversations that occur naturally in social and professional human interaction. I am mainly intrested in the problem of _automated generation of long and multi-turn utterances of a conversation given a context._ This can be handy for customer support, chatbots for empowering interactive healthcare care, additional dataset for developing other machine learning-based models, etc. The problem is because of semantic and functional dependencies like co-reference relation (i.e., identification of two or more expressions in a text refer to the same person or thing), dialogue elements, and their context. To achieve this goal we will levarage  modern neural architecture (i.e., Transformers), attention models (i.e., self-attention, cross-attention, etc.), and contextual text representations (from BERT, GPT, etc.).
