### Engaging Humans with Conversational AI: Automated Generation of Long and Multi-turn Natural Conversations
Conversational AI (Conv-AI) is the study of techniques for software agents that can engage in natural conversation with humans. The modern Conversational systems, Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri Google Home, and Microsoft Cortana, focus on short instructions such as playing music or asking for information, as opposed to longer free-form conversations that occur naturally in social and professional human interaction. I am mainly interested in the problem of _automated generation of long and multi-turn utterances of a conversation given a context._ This can be useful: for customer support; for empowering interactive healthcare care; for the additional dataset, which can be augmented with other machine learning-based models, etc. The problem is challenging because of semantic and functional dependencies like co-reference relation (i.e., identifying two or more expressions in a text refer to the same person or thing), dialogue elements, and context. To achieve this goal, we will leverage modern neural architecture (i.e., Transformers), attention models (i.e., self-attention, cross-attention, etc.), and contextual text representations (i.e., BERT, GPT, etc.).
