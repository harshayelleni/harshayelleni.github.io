### Hey, I'm Kaushal Kumar Maurya!


I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iith.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Techonlogy Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/). I am advised by Dr. [Maunendra Sankar Desarkar](https://www.iith.ac.in/~maunendra/).


My research goal is oriented towards applied machine learning for natural language processing. In particular, I leverage deep learning and deep reinforcement learning to solve challenging natural language generation problems. I have been mostly approaching issues from the linguistic side. As a multilingual myself, I envision a need for cross-lingual/multilingual generation models (specifically for Indian languages), which can directly apply to low-resource settings for conversation generation, distractor generation, question generation, text summarization, etc. I previously worked on _In-line mathematical expression detection_, _evaluation of text generation_, and _distractor generation (generation of incorrect options for reading comprehension)_.


Before joining PhD, I worked in AI Startup i.e., [NTWIST](https://ntwist.com/) as _data science analyst_. Prior to this, I completed my M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence from [University of Hyderabad](https://www.uohyd.ac.in/) under the guidance of Prof. [K. Narayana Murthy](http://languagetechnologies.uohyd.ac.in/) after completing my B.Tech from Uttar Pradesh Technical University.
